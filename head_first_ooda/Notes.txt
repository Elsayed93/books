Ch5: 

- Abstract classes are placeholders for actual implementation classes.

- The abstract class defines behavior, and the subclasses implement that behavior.

- Whenever you find common behavior in two
or more places, look to abstract that behavior
into a class, and then reuse that behavior in
the common classes.
